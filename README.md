## 🐳 Docker Setup & Development Workflow

You can run and develop this app fully inside a Docker container.

### 🔧 Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t webeng2 .
```

### 🚀 Run the Container

```bash
docker run -p 4173:4173 webeng2
```

This serves the app in production mode on `http://localhost:4173`.

---

## 👨‍💻 Developing Inside Docker

To enable live development, including Git support and local file syncing, run the container with volume mounts:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 4173:4173 -v $(pwd):/app -w /app node:slim bash
```

Then inside the container:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Your local files will be reflected inside the container. You can also use `git` inside this shell, as long as it's installed in the container or mounted via volumes.

For Git inside the container:

```bash
apt update && apt install -y git
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

---

## 🧠 Using VSCode with Docker (Devcontainer)

To work in VSCode inside the container, do the following:

1. Make sure you have the **Remote - Containers** extension installed in VSCode.
2. Create a `.devcontainer` folder in the root of the project.
3. Add a `devcontainer.json` with this content:

```json
{
  "name": "WebEng2 Dev",
  "image": "node:slim",
  "workspaceFolder": "/app",
  "mounts": [
    "source=${localWorkspaceFolder},target=/app,type=bind"
  ],
  "postCreateCommand": "npm install",
  "customizations": {
    "vscode": {
      "extensions": ["dbaeumer.vscode-eslint"]
    }
  }
}
```

4. Reopen the project in container via the Command Palette:
```
> Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container
```

This gives you full Git integration, local file access, and the power of VSCode inside the container.

## 📜 Available Scripts

| Script         | Description                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `npm run dev`  | Start the development server (alias: `start`) |
| `npm run build`| Build the app for production and generate service worker |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint on the project source files      |

---

## ⚡ Vite

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) for development and bundling. All source code is in the `/src` folder. The configuration file is located at `vite.config.js`.

---

## 🌐 Progressive Web App (PWA)

This project is a PWA. During development, consider disabling the service worker in dev tools or using "Update on reload".

### Service Worker

A custom service worker is generated during the build via:

```bash
npx workbox generateSW workbox-config.js
```

---

## 🖼 Assets Management

Source images for icons and splash screens are in the `assets-src` folder. To regenerate app assets:

```bash
framework7 assets
```

Or launch the Framework7 asset editor:

```bash
framework7 assets --ui
```
